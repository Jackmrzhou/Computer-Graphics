##Ray Tracer
A simple ray tracer, which implements basic render operations:
* Generate ray
* Intersection
* Shading

The shading model is Blinn-Phong model, and I ignore the ambient color.
The shadow and reflect is also available, but only the ground can reflect.(Because of not using recursion. Maybe one day I will update.)

The final render result is final.png.![](https://github.com/Jackmrzhou/Computer-Graphics/blob/master/final.png?raw=true)

##Transformation Matrix
Using 2*2 matrix to rotate or scale a picture.

Why use EasyX? Because it is the simplest to see the result.**
