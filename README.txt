A simple ray tracer, which implements basic render operations:
1> Generate Ray.
2> Intersection.
3> Shading.
The shading model is Blinn-Phong Model, and I delete the ambient color.
The shadow is also available.

If you want to run it on your own machine, please download EasyX.
Why use EasyX? Because it is the simplest to see the result.

My compile environment:VS 2017

I have not add the reflectness.
